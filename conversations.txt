WILL +  Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included? + SEAN +  Have you read all these books, Will? + WILL +  Probably not. + SEAN +  How about the ones on that shelf? + 
WILL +  Yeah, I read those. + SEAN +  What did you think? + WILL +  I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em? + SEAN +  I did. + WILL +  That must have taken you a long time. + SEAN +  Yeah, it did take me a long time. + 
WILL +  "A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass. + SEAN +  How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?" + WILL +  You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books. + SEAN +  You think so? + WILL +  Whatever blows your hair back. + 
SEAN +  Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth. + WILL +  You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing. + 
SEAN +  Yes, I do. + WILL +  Nautilus? + SEAN +  Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench? + SEAN +  285. + WILL +  Oh. + 
SEAN +  Yeah. Do you paint? + WILL +  No. + SEAN +  Crayons? + WILL +  This is a real piece of shit. + SEAN +  Tell me what you really think. + WILL +  Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me. + SEAN +  What does? + WILL +  The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting. + SEAN +  What is? + WILL +  I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off. + SEAN +  Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh? + WILL +  You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?" + SEAN +  Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"-- + WILL +  --Well, maybe that means you. + SEAN +  Maybe what mea-- + 
SEAN +  Maybe you should be a patient and sit down. + WILL +  Maybe you married the wrong woman. + SEAN +  Watch your mouth. + WILL +  That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else? + 
SEAN +  If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you. + WILL +  Time's up. + 
WILL +  So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about? + SEAN +  I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me? + WILL +  No. + SEAN +  You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about. + WILL +  Why thank you. + SEAN +  You've never been out of Boston. + WILL +  No. + SEAN +  So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right? + 
WILL +  You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!" + SEAN +  You've never been on a plane. + WILL +  I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person. + 
SEAN +  Yeah? You got a lady now? + WILL +  Yeah, I went on a date last week. + SEAN +  How'd it go? + WILL +  Fine. + SEAN +  Well, are you going out again? + WILL +  I don't know. + SEAN +  Why not? + WILL +  Haven't called her. + SEAN +  Jesus Christ, you are an amateur. + WILL +  I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun... + SEAN +  So Christ, call her up. + WILL +  Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that. + SEAN +  And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that. + 
SEAN +  I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it. + WILL +  You ever think about gettin' remarried? + SEAN +  My wife's dead. + WILL +  Hence, the word remarried. + SEAN +  My wife's dead. + WILL +  Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone. + 
SEAN +  Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night. + SEAN +  No, I don't. + WILL +  Why not? + SEAN +  I gave that up when my wife got sick. + WILL +  Is that why you didn't write anything else? + SEAN +  I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one. + WILL +  Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon? + SEAN +  Yeah. + WILL +  What happened to that guy from Kentucky? + SEAN +  Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick. + WILL +  Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife? + SEAN +  What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife? + 
WILL +  You don't regret meetin' your wife? + SEAN +  Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her. + WILL +  When did you know she was the one? + SEAN +  October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them. + WILL +  Where were you? + SEAN +  I was havin' a drink with my future wife. + WILL +  You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met? + SEAN +  That's right. + WILL +  So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away? + SEAN +  You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room. + WILL +  I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series! + 
SEAN +  I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl." + WILL +  "I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say? + SEAN +  They could see that I meant it. + WILL +  You're kiddin' me. + SEAN +  No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game. + 
WILL +  Would have been nice to catch that game though. + SEAN +  Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run. + 
SEAN +  So you might be working for Uncle Sam. + WILL +  I don't know. + SEAN +  Gerry says the meeting went well. + WILL +  I guess. + SEAN +  What did you think? + WILL +  What did I think? + 
SEAN +  Do you think you're alone? + WILL +  What? + SEAN +  Do you have a soul-mate? + WILL +  Define that. + SEAN +  Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate. + WILL +  Yeah. + 
SEAN +  They're all dead. + WILL +  Not to me, they're not. + SEAN +  But you can't give back to them, Will. + WILL +  Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no... + SEAN +  That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road. + WILL +  Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this? + SEAN +  Don't give me you line of shit. + WILL +  I didn't want the job. + SEAN +  It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do? + WILL +  I didn't ask for this. + SEAN +  Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out. + WILL +  Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that. + SEAN +  You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man. + 
WILL +  What? + SEAN +  If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time. + WILL +  What? + 
SEAN +  I been there. I played my hand. + WILL +  That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again! + SEAN +  Look at me. What do you want to do? + 
WILL +  Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy. + SEAN +  Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you. + WILL +  Do you want to talk about it? + 
SEAN +  Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation. + WILL +  You're not going to fail me are you? + 
SEAN +  You want to read it? + WILL +  No.  Have you had any experience with that? + SEAN +  Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of-- + WILL +  --No, have you had any experience with that? + SEAN +  Yes. + WILL +  It sure ain't good. + 
SEAN +  Gotta go with the belt there... + WILL +  I used to go with the wrench. + SEAN +  The wrench, why? + WILL +  Cause fuck him, that's why. + 
WILL +  Oh, I know. + SEAN +  It's not your fault. + WILL +  I know. + SEAN +  It's not your fault. + WILL +  I know. + SEAN +  It's not your fault. + WILL +  I know. + SEAN +  It's not your fault. + WILL +  Don't fuck with me. + SEAN +  It's not your fault. + WILL +  I know. + SEAN +  It's not... + WILL +  I know, I know... + 
SEAN +  Which one did you take, Will? + WILL +  Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy. + SEAN +  That's what you want? + WILL +  Yeah, I think so. + SEAN +  Good for you. Congratulations. + WILL +  Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done? + SEAN +  We're done. You did your time. You're a free man. + 
WILL +  I just want you to know, Sean... + SEAN +  You're Welcome, Will. + WILL +  I'll keep in touch. + SEAN +  I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be. + 
SEAN +  No. Thank you. + WILL +  Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship? + SEAN +  Only if you grab my ass. + 
WILL +  See ya. + SEAN +  Good luck. +
